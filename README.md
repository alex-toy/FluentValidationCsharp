# Fluent Validation In C#

**FluentValidation** is a .NET library for building strongly-typed validation rules. It makes custom model validation really simple and flexible with a powerful fluent API. In this project, we will use **FluentValidation** to validate a POCO model class and override the built in validation middleware.
